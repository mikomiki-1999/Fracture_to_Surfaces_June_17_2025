# Metal Fractures Surface Repository  

This repository is dedicated to collecting **images of metal fractures** from various sources. The goal is to create a visual reference for engineers, researchers, and students studying failure analysis and fracture mechanics.  

## How to Contribute  

We are looking for **high-quality images** that showcase metal fractures Surface in different materials and conditions. If you have relevant images, please contribute!  

### Submission Guidelines  
1. **Upload your images** to the `images/` folder.  
2. **Provide a brief description** of each image, including:  
   - Material type (if known)  
   - Loading conditions (if applicable)  
   - Any observations about the fracture pattern  
3. **File format**: Preferably `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.tiff`.  

## Why Contribute?  
By sharing images, you help build a valuable visual database for understanding metal Fracture failures. This collection can support research, education, and practical failure analysis.  

Let's document and explore metal fractures together!
